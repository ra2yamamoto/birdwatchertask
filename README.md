# Running the task:
In order to run the task, run `main.py` from the psychopy Runner. The task also uses numpy and pandas so those may need to be installed if they are not in your python environment.

# Cancelling the task:
If you need to quit the task while it's running, press escape during an instruction page. The data collected up to the last "rule block" will be saved if the program is quit in this way, however the data won't be saved if the program is quit by the operating system (using CMD-Q on Mac, e.g.). Pressing the button to stop the program in the psychopy Runner will also save the data collected up to that point.

# Output:
Output is stored automatically in the output folder and labeled by the participant's id.
